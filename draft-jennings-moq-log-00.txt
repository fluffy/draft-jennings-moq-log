                 Logging over Media over QUIC Transport
                       draft-jennings-moq-log-00

Abstract

   Real time systems often run into the problems where the network
   bandwidth for logging in shared with the real time media and impacts
   the media quality.  There is a desire to transport the logging data
   at an appropriate priority level over the same transport as the
   media.  This allows the logging data to take advantage of times when
   the media bitrate is blow the peak rate while not impact the peak
   rate available for media.

   This document specifies how to send syslog RFC5424 type information
   over the Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT) [I-D.ietf-moq-transport].

1.  Introduction

   The idea is each device that was logging would publish each log
   message as an MOQT object.  The devices or systems publishing the
   logs are referred to as resources and have an unique ResourceID.  The
   URLs for the objects would be set up such that a subscriber could
   subscribe to each resource creating logs separately, and could pick
   the log priority level in the subscriptions.  The log collector would
   subscribe to the logs from the appropriate Resources that the
   collector wished to monitor.

   The data model used is consistent with the "OpenTelemetry
   Specification" [OTEL] (see
   https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/)
   (https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/)) and a
   superset of the [RFC5424] data model for logging.

   [RFC5424] specifies a layered architecture that provides for support
   of any number of transport layer mappings for transmitting syslog
   messages.  This document describes the MOQT transport mapping for the
   syslog protocol.

2.1.  Resource ID

   Each Resource that creates logs has a unique resourceID.  This is
   created by taking the MAC address of the primary network interface in
   binary, computing the SHA1 hash of it, then truncating to lower 64
   bits.  Note the SHA1 does not provide any security priories, it is
   just a hash that is widely implemented in hardware.  If this is not
   possible, any other random stable 64 bit identifier may be used.  The
   advantage of us MAC address is that many other management systems use
   this address and using it makes it easier to correlate with other
   systems.  The disadvantage is that it reveals the MAC address.

3.  Naming

   The Namespace used is "moq://moq-syslog.arpa/logs-v1/"

   The Track name used is the binary resourceID followed by a single
   byte that has the log priority level in binary.  Following the
   pattern:

    <resourceID>/<log_level>

   The MOQT Group ID is timestamp (explain in the next section) in the
   message truncated to a 62 bit binary integer.

   The MOQT Object ID is zero unless more than one message is produced
   in the same microseconds in which case they each will get their own
   object number.

4.  Object Data

   The object payload is a JSON [RFC8259] object with the following
   optional fields:

   *  severity: As defined in [RFC5424].  Encoded as string "Emergency",
      "Alert", ... "Debug".  This is called ServerText in [OTEL].

   *  timestamp: single integer with number of microseconds since "1 Jan
      1972" using NTP Era zero conventions.

   *  pri: As defined in [RFC5424].  Numeric value from 0 to 23 and
      default is 1 if not present.

   *  hostname: As defined in [RFC5424].  Note this might not be a
      hostname.

   *  appname: As defined in [RFC5424].

   *  procid: As defined in [RFC5424].

   *  msgid: As defined in [RFC5424].

   *  msg: As defined in [RFC5424].  This is a UTF-8 string.

   Any other fields are treated as structured data as defined in
   [RFC5424] and include:

   *  TraceID: Used in [OTEL] and defined in
      [CRD-trace-context-2-20240328].

   *  SpanID: As defined in [OTEL].

   *  InstrumentationScope: As defined in [OTEL].

   Any other fields are treated as "Attributes" when mapped to [OTEL].

5.  IANA

   TBD

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD

7.  Examples

   On 31 Dec 1999 UTC a server produces the log message "shutting down
   for Y2K" with severity INFO.  The timestamp for this would be
   3,155,587,200.  The JSON data would be:

   {
      "timestamp":3155587200,
      "severity":"Info",
      "msg":"shutting down forY2K"
   }
